            <h3>Participant Financial Support Attestation *</h3>
            <p>* This document only needs to be completed if Participant Financial Supports (PFS) were claimed for project costs.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>As a CWRG Agreement Holder, I confirm that the Participant Financial Supports (PFS) funds, as set out in Schedule A of the contract, were spent to support participants as required. The intention of these funds was to remove barriers to participants&rsquo; successful participation, completion of training, and outcomes.&nbsp; CWRG may contact Participants randomly after the project to confirm their receipt of funds for Participant Financial Supports.</li>
                <li>I confirm that all original documents pertaining to PFS expenses will be retained for up to seven years and may be subject to audit or requested for verification purposes. Examples of documents may include receipts, mileage logs, books of account, and vouchers.&nbsp;</li>
                <li>
                    If the total amount of funds claimed for Participant Financial Supports per Schedule A of the contract is greater than the amount provided to participants as PFS expenses, I will contact a CWRG Program Manager to initiate repayment of any unspent PFS funding.
